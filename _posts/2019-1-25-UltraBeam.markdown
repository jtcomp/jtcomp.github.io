I recently discovered a facinating, but little used phenominon in acustic engineering. 

Modulated waves of ultrasound (in the 40 Khz range) can be demodulated by air itself on contact with an object. 

Ultrasound, having a much shorter wavelength than the audible range of sound diffracts much less. 

I've created an initial design and ordered a board, but currently it is stuck in shipping.
