I've been wanting to get into night photography, but the cost of a tripod and controller always seemed like way to much to pay. Tripod can run anywhere from 25$ to hundreds of dollars and the controllers start at about $15 for a total of around $50 to $100. So, I set off on a cheaper solution.

First, I worked to find a cheap controller. Luckily, my Nexus 5X and my borrowed Cannon 40D are compatible with this wonderful app from __. I found a USB OTG cable around Valencia, tried out the free version of the app and bought it for $7 when it worked.  Remote pictures, videos, HDR and long exposure with touch screen control!

Total: ~12$

Next, the tripod. I wanted something like a Gorilla Pod, without the price of one. I remembered seeing bendy foam sticks in one of the Chinese Bazars that are common in Valencia. I found a pack (turns out they're for your hair) for about 1 euro. They turned out to be too bendy though, so I replaced the thin metal cores with thicker wire cut out of coat hangers I found in my closet. They worked much better. 

I had to find some way to attach the camera to the tripod, so I found a bolt at a local hardware store that fit. It turned out to be too short, so I had to find another one, and the guy just gave me the bolt. But, I didn't have an easy way to join the bolt and the coat hangers together. I search the hardware store with one of the employees until I found something perfect: the round, rubber replacement shoe of a stool. I had basically no tools in Spain, but I managed to punch a hole through the foot with a skrewdriver and a hammer. The bolt fit nicely through. To join everything together, I twisted the wires of the four coat hangers around the bolt in a helix until they formed a tight assembly. Then I skrewed it all into the hole of the foot. Everything worked well. The legs formed a sturdy base for the camera, and when the camera skrewed onto the bolt the rubber of the shoe held it tightly. All together (even with a bit of R&D cost) the tripod cost me about $3.

Full total: $15

Not bad.
