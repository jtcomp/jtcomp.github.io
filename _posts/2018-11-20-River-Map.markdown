description: Creating a laser engraved river map
tag: [Projects]

I wanted to create a minimalist map of the river systems of Wisconsin, inspired by [Nelson Minar's map](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-map-of-all-the-rivers-in-the-united-states-and-nothi-513353739) of the United States. But I wanted to laser engrave it.

I needed to strike a good balance with the level of detail I included to keep the map looking "full" without overdoint it. I would need extremely high resolution data.

The Wisconsin DNR's [24K Hydro database](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=cb1c7f75d14f42ee819a46894fd2e771) turned out to be the answer. I had to find the file on ARCGis because the DNR's links turned out to be broken. I didn't have access to any Esri software but [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) turned out to be a wonderfully well put together open source GIS tool.

I figured out how to import the DNR's massive amount information. It was quickly clear that I would have to filter out finer details. 

The general process with laser cutting at the UW consisted of generating the raster, cut and engrave layers in Illustrator. However, Illustrator could not handle the massive SVGs I was creating in QGIS. 

Thus, I filtered out a massive amount of the DNR's database which turned out to include ponds and streams so small one in your backyard would show up. I threw most of these almost invisibly small datapoints out.

Even still, these files were still massive and error prone in Illustrator. PDF generation generally worked better although it still produced errors. 

The final step, loading the file into the cutter turned out to be additionally problematic. The import software was prone to bugs with these files. I was trying to a massive amount of engraving, but the laser would randomly stop about 10 minutes into the cut. The staff had never seen it before. 

I converted the entire file and cut it as a raster, but it didn't give the clean cut look I was going for. My current solution is simplify the river geometery as much as possible to reduce the total number of vectors. 

Potentially, if that still doesn't work, I will subdivide the file into quadrants and engrave them one at a time.
