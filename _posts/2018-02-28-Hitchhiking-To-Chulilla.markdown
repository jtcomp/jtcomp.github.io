A friend and I decided to try to hitchhike to Chulilla from Valencia after classes on Wednesday. Apperently, hitchhiking is a challenge in Spain, but we didn't let this get us down. We took the tram as far out of the city as we could, and then camped out next to a roundabout  with a shitty hand drawn sign. 

We decided to split the trip up into three different legs, and first get to Lliria. After a lot of failed attempts and excited attempts to stop cars, an older man and his daughter stopped and gave us a ride to Lliria. We got dropped off on the side of an on-ramp to the highway. The search for someone to Casinos was harder, but eventually a van stopped for us. He had actually already driven past us, but on the highway he had a change of heart, turned around, and drove all the way back to pick us up.

The man owned a shotty van and spoke no English. Through our limited Spanish we found out that he was a semifamous paintor, who lived in the mountains and dabbled in politics. His son was in Poland, and was living close to where my friend was from. So he was very interested in talking about Poland and where we from. With my lack of Spanish I thought he insisted on me buying him a beer. But since he was going to go way out of his way to drive us to Chulilla I had no problem with it. So we hung out in a bar for about an hour talking about Spanish politics.

Finally we got on the way to Chulilla, went to the climbing bar and found my friend's shoes. We climbed a few routes before it started to get too dark and then we started on the journey of leaving. It dawned on me that this was going to be almost impossible, as there was basically no one in the streets. It was dark, raining and cold and it looked like our hitchhiking chances here were slim. 

So we started off, hiking toward the nearest highway which was about 7km away. About an hour later we got there and found a gas station, but realized we were still fucked. 

So eventually we called a friend for a favor and they drove us all the way back to Valencia.
